			'All of the pieces of information and knowledge I learned are pretty far from what I want to become. There are still a lot of holes that need to fill up. Last night, I finished this simple project where it will randomly generate your public information just by typing your name in the input box just for fun. I shared this project with my programming community and someone said that it was entertaining, I became happy at that point. So, I’ve decided to make some projects that have similarities to my last project starting now. I want to push myself to the limits as I learn new things. But somehow, all of the knowledge I have right now doesn’t come from the school I’m going to. I learned this by watching youtube videos and reading books. I’ve been thinking at some point if it is going alright. I want to jump right into learning React framework but I just can’t jump into another topic without mastering JavaScript. I just know the basics and now I’m starting to work on manipulating APIs. I’ll keep continuing it. Learning never stops.',

			'Hi! I’m new to this medium platform and I have no idea what should I do so here’s my story please bare with me. My journey has been tough for me. There are a lot of things that I need to learn. As of now, I’m currently learning web designing and manipulating APIs. I’m struggling with whether should I take track of web designing or be a web developer. I love both of them. So while we were doing our capstone research, I made the designs of our project as well the frontend UI and its functionalities. It took me weeks up until now. I’m looking for ways to make my code more readable. Ps. And I want to post here on medium because I want to practice my professional writing. This is nothing compared to you guys. I’ll try to post next week. Thank you.',
